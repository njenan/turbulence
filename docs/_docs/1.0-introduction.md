Turbulence is a performance testing tool built from the ground up for the modern deployment pipeline. Turbulence is designed to easily support distributed testing, as well as be open to extensibility through the use of plugins.  Turbulence defines its test scripts in a Javascript DSL; that means nothing beyond a simple text editor is needed to write and modify test scripts, and Turbulence can be run from the command line, meaning integration with CI tools is easy.


Turbulence is written in NodeJS and utilizes non-blocking IO, this means that it can simulate more concurrent users than thread-based performance testing tools, and its memory footprint is always as small as possible.

 
Easy of use, along with flexibility and brevity were chief design goals for Turbulence, and its Api is easy to use and expressive.
