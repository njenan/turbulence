Installation of turbulence is easy.  Frist, make sure you have NodeJs installed.  This can be checked from the command line:

    node -v
    > V6.9.1
    
It is recommended to have at least version 6.9.1 of Node installed.  If you do not have NodeJs installed, it can be downloaded at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). Once you have NodeJs installed, install Turbulence:

    npm install -g turbulence

This will allow you to run turbulence from any directory.  This is useful when testing scripts locally, but when integrating into an existing project it is recommended that turbulence be installed with other dependencies.  First, check that a `package.json` file exists, if it does not, create it in the project directory with:

    npm init -f
    
This will create a basic `package.json` file in the project directory.  Turbulence can then be installed with

    npm install --save-dev turbulence
    
This will ensure that turbulence is always available in CI systems as well as ensuring a consistent version is used for tests.  A npm script can then be created such as:

    scripts: {
        "performance-test": "turbulence my-test-plan.turbulence"
    }

And run with:

    npm run performance-test

This allows npm to help manage the version and `$PATH` variables, ensuring a consistent testing environment.
