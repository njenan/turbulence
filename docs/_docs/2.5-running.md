After installation, Turbulence can be run from the command line:
 
    turbulence <test-plans>

Where `test-plans` is a comma separated list of paths to turbulence test files.  `trb` is also provided as an alias for brevity, so:

    trb my-test-plan.turblence
    
is equivelent to

    turbulence my-test-plan.turblence
